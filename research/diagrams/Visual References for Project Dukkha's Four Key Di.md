## Visual References for Project Dukkha's Four Key Diagrams

Based on the detailed visual specifications you've provided, I've found several diagrams and visuals that capture the essence of your four intended diagrams. Here's how existing visual references align with your Project Dukkha aesthetic vision:

### 1. The Ping/Scroll Loop (Attention.html)

The **dopamine reward loop diagram**

Diagram of the dopamine reward loop illustrating the cyclical relationship between smartphone use, dopamine increase, pleasure, and dopamine decrease.

perfectly captures the cyclical nature of your ping/scroll concept. This visual shows the clean, minimalist cyclical flowchart you're aiming for, with:

- Smooth curved arrows creating an intuitive loop flow
- Clear nodes representing each stage of the digital distraction cycle
- Simple, modern design that emphasizes the self-reinforcing nature of the behavior
- Visual emphasis on the dopamine spike moment (highlighted brain illustration)

The **behavioral control theory flowchart**

also demonstrates the systematic loop structure with clear directional arrows and feedback mechanisms that could inform your intervention points design.

### 2. Dopamine Baseline vs. Spike (Recovery.html, Model.html)

The **scientific dopamine activity graph**

![Scientific line graph showing dopamine activity spikes and recovery over time in mice following a cue, capturing dopamine baseline and spike dynamics.](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1755626187/pplx_project_search_images/8974090121e1d322d4a94ebb55e34a3a96c5a759.png)

Scientific line graph showing dopamine activity spikes and recovery over time in mice following a cue, capturing dopamine baseline and spike dynamics.

provides an excellent reference for your dopamine dynamics visualization. This research-grade chart shows:

- Precise baseline and spike patterns over time
- Clean axes with proper scientific labeling
- Multiple traces showing the consistency of dopamine response patterns
- Clear demonstration of the sharp rise, peak, and return to baseline that you want to illustrate

This scientific visualization captures exactly the authoritative, clean aesthetic you're seeking for showing dopamine's compensatory dip and gradual recovery.

### 3. Stress-Sensitization Loop (with Exit Points) (Recovery.html)

The **stress feedback loop diagram**

![Diagram illustrating the biological stress feedback loop from stress to cortisol release and hippocampal impairment.](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1754678571/pplx_project_search_images/ce5db2b023203e4a26456cd191fbe4ec24b9897a.png)

Diagram illustrating the biological stress feedback loop from stress to cortisol release and hippocampal impairment.

illustrates the physiological stress cycle with clear feedback mechanisms:

- Shows how stress impacts higher brain functions and creates cascading effects
- Uses different arrow styles to indicate stimulation, inhibition, and impairment
- Demonstrates the cyclical nature of stress reinforcement through cortisol pathways
- Provides a foundation for understanding where intervention points could break the cycle

The **PTSD feedback loop diagram**

![A hand-drawn diagram illustrating the PTSD survival mode feedback loop, showing how unprocessed traumatic memories cause fear and avoidance, and the importance of therapeutic integration.](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1755626164/pplx_project_search_images/c7bda02ec4d2abf869b447e1a3914366612bb536.png)

A hand-drawn diagram illustrating the PTSD survival mode feedback loop, showing how unprocessed traumatic memories cause fear and avoidance, and the importance of therapeutic integration.

offers another perspective on psychological feedback loops with intervention concepts, showing how therapeutic interventions can break negative cycles.

### 4. The Reward Compass (Model.html)

The **RCVE Project Prioritization Matrix**

![RCVE project prioritization matrix categorizing projects by effort, risk, cost, and value for decision-making.](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1755626164/pplx_project_search_images/67204a0a9bd0836e7b641485827d40f53382dd90.png)

RCVE project prioritization matrix categorizing projects by effort, risk, cost, and value for decision-making.

demonstrates the clean 2x2 quadrant design you're envisioning:

- Four distinct colored quadrants with clear labeling
- Intersecting axes representing different dimensions
- Clean typography and professional presentation
- Visual emphasis on the optimal quadrant (green "Prioritize" section)

The **Digital Flourishing Wheel**

![The Digital Flourishing Wheel illustrates eight key elements of digital wellness, each with detailed subcategories for holistic assessment.](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1755626187/pplx_project_search_images/9ca4d53dc60ae4906ef4d61213693214a53ee028.png)

The Digital Flourishing Wheel illustrates eight key elements of digital wellness, each with detailed subcategories for holistic assessment.

provides additional inspiration for reward system visualization, though in circular rather than quadrant format, showing how multiple dimensions of digital wellness can be mapped systematically.

### Supporting Design Elements

The **wellness frameworks**

demonstrate clean, professional approaches to visualizing interconnected psychological and behavioral concepts, while the **digital wellness categorization**

![A visual overview of digital and AI technologies transforming mental health, categorized by type and user interaction fidelity.](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1755217886/pplx_project_search_images/857a7f6e0ff49fa75847aa7967b115744d8e91f2.png)

A visual overview of digital and AI technologies transforming mental health, categorized by type and user interaction fidelity.

shows how complex behavioral technologies and interventions can be systematically organized and presented.

These visual references collectively capture the essence of your four diagrams: cyclical behavioral loops, scientific precision in graphing neurochemical responses, intervention-focused feedback systems, and systematic frameworks for understanding reward states. They align with your goal of creating premium, guidebook-quality visuals that are both scientifically grounded and intuitively accessible to users seeking to understand and modify their digital behavior patterns.
