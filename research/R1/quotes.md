> “‘Wanting’…is generated by large and robust neural systems (including mesolimbic dopamine), whereas ‘liking’…is mediated by smaller and fragile systems not dependent on dopamine.” — Berridge & Robinson 2016, p. 670 (key: berridge2016)

> “Optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons concurrent with reward delivery…was sufficient to cause long-lasting increases in cue-elicited reward-seeking behavior.” — Steinberg et al. 2013, p. 970 (key: steinberg2013)

> “Despite early evidence for the anhedonia hypothesis, dopamine does not appear to be necessary to cause normal ‘liking’ reactions…nor are dopamine increases sufficient to amplify hedonic impact… In short, dopamine activation does not appear to cause the hedonic impact of reward.” — Berridge 2007, p. 397 (key: berridge1998)
