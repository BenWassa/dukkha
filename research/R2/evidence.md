**Core mechanism.** Variable reward and novelty are potent drivers of attention and approach. Classic operant work shows intermittent schedules sustain high, persistent responding (ferster1957). In smartphones, *checking* is a brief, frequent habit reinforced by fast informational rewards (oulasvirta2012). Notifications capture attention and impair task performance even when ignored (stothart2015).

**Novelty & exploration.** Human fMRI links novelty to SN/VTA and hippocampal systems, promoting exploration and learning (bunzeck2006; krebs2009; lisman2005). Infinite feeds exploit continuous novelty; HCI fieldwork shows context-aware frictions can curb scrolling when well timed (meinhardt2025).

**Mitigations—individual level (priority).**
- **Batch notifications** to 3×/day: better attention/mood/control; stress ↓; full shutoff can raise anxiety/FoMO (fitz2019).
- **Cue removal/desaturation:** disable non‑essential notifications, move/remove app icons; supported within multi‑strategy RCT reducing screen time/problematic use (olson2022).
- **Grayscale:** reduces use and problematic symptoms with modest effects; compliance varies (holte2020; dekker2024; wickord2023).

**Guardrails—system level (secondary).** Context-sensitive **frictions** (pause/confirm, timely prompts) during infinite scroll reduce overuse but can reduce satisfaction; design for optionality and timing (meinhardt2025; ruiz2024).

**Populations.** Adolescents show heightened reward sensitivity and peer‑amplified seeking—apply stronger defaults (e.g., notification batching by default, bedtime quiet hours) (galvan2006; chein2011). High‑frequency users exhibit stronger habit loops—expect greater gains from batching + frictions (oulasvirta2012; fitz2019).

**Practice takeaway.** Start with: (1) batch notifications 3×/day; (2) disable non‑essential alerts; (3) grayscale + move icons off home screen; (4) insert voluntary scroll-pauses at context‑relevant moments.
