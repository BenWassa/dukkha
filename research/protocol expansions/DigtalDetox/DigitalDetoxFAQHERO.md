# Digital Detox Protocol FAQ

**Q1. Why do a digital detox?**
Excessive screen use can worsen **mood**, **sleep quality**, **focus**, and **stress**. Reducing it often improves **mental health**, **well-being**, and **attention** within weeks (see \[1–6]).

**Q2. Does it actually work?**
Yes — multiple RCTs confirm benefits:
✓ ≤2 hrs/day for 3 weeks → reduced depression, stress, improved sleep & well-being.
✓ < 3 hrs/week of recreational screens → improved mood & well-being.
✓ 2-week mobile internet block → lower depression & anxiety, higher sustained attention.
✓ Meta-analyses: consistent effect in reducing depression (see \[1–5,7]).

**Q3. How should I start?**
Two proven paths:

* **Reset:**
  • Disable mobile internet for 1–2 weeks (calls/texts only).
  • Or limit recreational screens to < 3 hrs/week.
* **Sustain:**
  • Set daily limits (≤2 hrs/day for non-essential use).
  • Batch notifications (e.g., 3× daily), not full silence.
  • Use “If–Then” plans to resist temptations (see \[2–4,6,8]).

**Q4. Will the benefits last?**
They can fade if old habits return — screen time often rebounds after interventions. Long-term gains come from:
• Consistent planning & self-monitoring
• Building self-efficacy (confidence in managing usage)
• Mindful, strategic digital use (limits, batching)
• Combining multiple techniques (planning, goal setting, feedback) (see \[2–4,6,8,9]).
