Hero FAQ (Digital Detox Protocol)
**Q1. Why do a digital detox?**Excessive screen use can worsen mood, sleep quality, focus, and stress [1-5]. Reducing it often leads to improved mental health, well-being, and sustained attention within weeks [2, 4, 6-9].
**Q2. Does it actually work?**Yes — Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) show that:
• Cutting screen time to ≤2 hours/day for 3 weeks can significantly reduce depressive symptoms, stress, and improve well-being and sleep quality [2, 9-11].
• Limiting recreational screen use to <3 hours/week for 2 weeks can significantly improve self-reported well-being and mood [4, 7].
• Blocking mobile internet access for two weeks can significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety (as part of a mental health index), and improve subjective well-being and objectively measured sustained attention [6, 12, 13].
• Meta-analyses confirm a significant effect of digital detox in mitigating depression [1, 14, 15].
**Q3. How should I start?**You can either do a short, intensive "reset" or opt for gradual, sustainable changes:
• Intensive Reset:
    ◦ Full Mobile Internet Disconnect: Disable mobile internet access (including Wi-Fi and mobile data) on your smartphone for 1–2 weeks, allowing only calls and texts [6, 16]. This is a high-impact approach [6].
    ◦ Drastic Recreational Screen Reduction: Limit all recreational digital screen use to less than 3 hours per week for 1–2 weeks [4, 17].
• Sustainable Change:
    ◦ Set Daily Screen-Time Goals: Aim for ≤2 hours/day for non-essential activities, which has been shown to improve depressive symptoms, sleep, and well-being [2, 10, 11, 18, 19].
    ◦ Batch Notifications: Deliver notifications in scheduled batches (e.g., thrice-daily) to improve mood, focus, and reduce stress [8, 20-23]. However, avoid completely silencing all notifications, as this can increase anxiety and Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) [8, 24, 25].
    ◦ Develop "If-Then" Plans: Create specific plans for managing temptations or challenges (e.g., "IF I feel the urge to scroll, THEN I will open a book") [5, 26, 27].
**Q4. Will the benefits last?**The benefits of digital detox interventions can fade if old habits return, as screen time often increases rapidly after an intervention, approaching initial levels at follow-up [2, 3, 9, 28]. Long-term gains come from:
• Consistent Planning: Engaging in self-regulatory processes, including developing and adapting action and coping plans, is crucial for sustaining behavior change [5, 29-31].
• Building Self-Efficacy: Interventions that enhance your belief in your capability to manage smartphone use are associated with sustained reductions in usage [5, 32-34].
• Mindful Digital Engagement: Focusing on strategic reduction (like notification batching and daily limits) and mindful interaction rather than just short periods of abstinence is key for lasting positive effects [5, 8, 35, 36].
• Integration of Multiple Techniques: Combining planning with other behavior change techniques, such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback, can enhance effectiveness and sustainability [5, 37, 38].
