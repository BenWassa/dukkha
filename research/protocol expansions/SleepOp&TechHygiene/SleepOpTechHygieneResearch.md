# Sleep Optimization and Technology Hygiene: Evidence-Based Interventions

## Core Sleep Hygiene Interventions

### Consistent Sleep Schedule (Regular Bed/Wake Times) – Tier 1 Evidence

**Claim:** Maintaining consistent bedtimes and wake-up times (including weekends) promotes better sleep quality and overall health.

**Evidence:** A 2020 systematic review of 41 studies found that greater variability in sleep timing (irregular bed/wake times and “social jetlag”) was associated with adverse health outcomes, while regular sleep patterns predicted better health(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33054339/). An expert consensus panel in 2023 agreed that daily regularity in sleep timing is important for health and performance(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37684151/). In practice, young adults who kept a fixed wake-up time and routine reported higher sleep quality in daily sleep diaries(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34605392/).

**Citation:** Chaput et al. (2020), *Appl. Physiol. Nutr. Metab.*, DOI: 10.1139/apnm-2020-0032(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33054339/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37684151/); Miller et al. (2022), *J. Clin. Sleep Med.*(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34605392/).

**Protocol Relevance:** Encourage a regular sleep schedule by going to bed and rising at the same time every day. Consistency helps stabilize circadian rhythms, making it easier to fall asleep and wake feeling refreshed. Allow only small variations (≤1 hour) on weekends to avoid disrupting this rhythm. If you must catch up on sleep, evidence suggests using modest weekend “catch-up” sleep is beneficial without completely overturning your schedule(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37684151/).

### Pre-Bedtime Routine and Wind-Down – Tier 3 Evidence

**Claim:** Following a calming bedtime routine each night can cue the body for sleep and improve sleep onset.

**Evidence:** While direct RCT evidence in adults is limited, maintaining regular pre-sleep rituals is widely recommended. Observational research suggests that adults with stable daily routines have fewer insomnia symptoms(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2849790/), and a consistent routine is correlated with earlier bedtimes and shorter sleep latency in surveys(https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2964&context=dissertations). Many clinical sleep programs (and pediatric studies) find that incorporating relaxing activities (e.g. dimming lights, gentle stretching, reading) before bed reduces pre-sleep arousal and speeds sleep onset.

**Citation:** Shin et al. (2020), *Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health*(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2849790/); Mindell et al. (2015), *Sleep Med. Rev.* – consistent routines link to better sleep(https://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/S2352-7218(23)00166-3/fulltext).

**Protocol Relevance:** Develop a 20–60 minute wind-down routine before bedtime. This could include activities like showering, meditation, or reading (in dim light) at the same time each evening. Such routines train your brain to recognize it’s time to sleep and transition you into a more relaxed state, making it easier to fall asleep when you finally lie down.

### Light Exposure (Daylight and Darkness) – Tier 2 Evidence

**Claim:** Managing light exposure – getting bright light in the morning and minimizing light at night – helps regulate sleep quality.

**Evidence:** A randomized crossover trial in college students found that 5 days of morning bright light (∼1000 lux for 1.5 hours) improved night-time sleep efficiency and led to earlier sleep onset and shorter latency, compared to normal indoor light(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36058557/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36058557/). Morning light anchors the circadian clock, which can enhance nocturnal melatonin onset and deepen sleep. Conversely, exposure to bright light (especially blue-enriched light) in the evening suppresses melatonin and delays circadian timing(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom)(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom). Studies show that evening screen use (which emits blue light) increases sleep latency and reduces evening sleepiness by delaying melatonin secretion(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom)(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom).

**Citation:** He et al. (2023), *J. Sleep Res.*, DOI: 10.1111/jsr.13724(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36058557/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36058557/); Sleep Foundation, “Technology in the Bedroom” (2020)(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom)(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom).

**Protocol Relevance:** Increase exposure to natural or bright light in the morning (e.g. sunlight or a light therapy lamp shortly after waking) to strengthen your circadian rhythm. In the evening, dim household lights and avoid bright screens in the last hour before bed. Ideally, create a dark bedroom environment – use blackout curtains or an eye mask to eliminate outside light. Embracing this light/dark cycle will help your body produce melatonin at night and support more restorative sleep.

### Exercise Timing and Intensity – Tier 1 Evidence

**Claim:** Regular exercise benefits sleep quality, but vigorous workouts very late in the evening can hinder sleep onset.

**Evidence:** Exercise in general is associated with better sleep (improved slow-wave “deep” sleep and reduced insomnia symptoms)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/). A 2019 meta-analysis of 23 studies reported that evening exercise did not usually disrupt sleep; in fact it slightly increased deep sleep and reduced light sleep overall(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/). However, the same review found that very intense exercise within an hour of bedtime could impair sleep onset and efficiency(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/). A 2025 longitudinal study of 14,000+ adults wearing fitness trackers showed that exercising vigorously too close to bedtime was linked to delayed sleep and shorter sleep duration, whereas exercise finished ≥4 hours before bedtime had no negative effect on sleep(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x?error=cookies_not_supported&code=8f756564-d6dc-4721-9633-a38d8e8f7069)(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x?error=cookies_not_supported&code=8f756564-d6dc-4721-9633-a38d8e8f7069). In short, exercise is beneficial for sleep, but insufficient recovery time post-exercise can elevate nighttime heart rate and delay relaxation needed for sleep(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x?error=cookies_not_supported&code=8f756564-d6dc-4721-9633-a38d8e8f7069)(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x?error=cookies_not_supported&code=8f756564-d6dc-4721-9633-a38d8e8f7069).

**Citation:** Stutz et al. (2019), *Sports Med.*, DOI: 10.1007/s40279-018-1015-0(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/); Leota et al. (2025), *Nat. Commun.*, DOI: 10.1038/s41467-025-58271-x(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x?error=cookies_not_supported&code=8f756564-d6dc-4721-9633-a38d8e8f7069)(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x?error=cookies_not_supported&code=8f756564-d6dc-4721-9633-a38d8e8f7069).

**Protocol Relevance:** Continue to exercise regularly, as it can improve sleep quality and overall health. If you exercise in the evening, aim to finish workouts at least 3–4 hours before bedtime, especially for high-intensity or long-duration exercise. Light to moderate physical activity (e.g. yoga, relaxed stretching, walking) is generally fine even later in the evening and may even help some people unwind. Ensuring a sufficient cool-down period allows heart rate and core temperature to drop, facilitating an easier transition to sleep.

### Caffeine Timing and Intake – Tier 1 Evidence

**Claim:** Limiting caffeine, especially in the afternoon and evening, is critical for optimizing sleep duration and quality.

**Evidence:** Caffeine is a potent stimulant that can significantly disrupt sleep even when consumed hours before bed. A landmark placebo-controlled trial showed that 400 mg of caffeine (equivalent to ~3–4 cups of coffee) taken 6 hours before bedtime reduced total sleep time by over 1 hour and increased sleep disturbances, even though participants didn’t subjectively realize their sleep was impaired(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24235903/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24235903/). A 2023 meta-analysis of 24 studies quantified caffeine’s impact: on average, caffeine use led to ~45 minutes less total sleep, 9 minutes longer time to fall asleep, and a 7% drop in sleep efficiency(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36870101/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36870101/). It also lightens sleep (increasing light stage N1 sleep and suppressing deep slow-wave sleep)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36870101/). The meta-analysis concluded that to avoid meaningful sleep loss, a typical cup of coffee (~100 mg caffeine) should be consumed at least 8–9 hours before bed, and a strong pre-workout dose (~200+ mg) may need to be cut off 13+ hours prior(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36870101/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36870101/).

**Citation:** Drake et al. (2013), *J. Clin. Sleep Med.*(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24235903/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24235903/); Gardiner et al. (2023), *Sleep Med. Rev.*, DOI: 10.1016/j.smrv.2023.101764(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36870101/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36870101/).

**Protocol Relevance:** To protect your sleep, set a “caffeine curfew.” For most adults, this means avoiding caffeine after about 2:00 PM (earlier if you have an early bedtime). Be mindful of all sources: coffee, tea, energy drinks, and even moderate amounts of caffeine can impair sleep if taken too late. If you are sensitive or have trouble sleeping, consider a stricter cutoff (morning only). In the evening, opt for decaffeinated beverages or herbal teas. This reduction in late-day caffeine will help ensure easier sleep onset and deeper, more continuous sleep through the night.

### Alcohol in the Evening – Tier 1 Evidence

**Claim:** Avoid using alcohol as a sleep aid – while it can make you drowsy, even moderate evening drinking disrupts the quality of your sleep.

**Evidence:** A comprehensive 2025 meta-analysis (27 studies) on alcohol’s effects showed that even low doses of alcohol (as little as 1–2 standard drinks) reduce REM sleep duration and delay the first REM cycle(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39631226/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39631226/). Higher doses (e.g. ~4–5+ drinks) can make you fall asleep faster and into deep sleep quicker, but this is misleading – such doses caused even greater suppression of REM sleep and more sleep fragmentation later in the night(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39631226/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39631226/). In other words, alcohol’s sedative effect is short-lived: as it’s metabolized in the second half of the night, sleep becomes lighter and more disturbed, often with more awakenings and earlier morning awakening. Large observational studies likewise find that people who drink more (especially in the evening) report poorer sleep quality and more awakenings during the night(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11077453/)(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871625001140).

**Citation:** Gardiner et al. (2025), *Sleep Med. Rev.*, DOI: 10.1016/j.smrv.2024.102030(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39631226/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39631226/); Chen et al. (2018), *Nat Sci Sleep*, DOI: 10.2147/NSS.S164898(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11077453/).

**Protocol Relevance:** For better sleep, limit alcohol in the hours before bedtime. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation and try to have your last drink at least 3–4 hours before sleep. Be aware that a “nightcap” might help you doze off, but it’s likely to rob you of restorative REM sleep and lead to a lighter, less refreshing night. Instead of alcohol, consider non-alcoholic alternatives or relaxing herbal teas in the evening. Over time, minimizing evening alcohol will improve your sleep continuity and how you feel the next morning.

### Bedroom Environment (Dark, Cool, Quiet) – Tier 2 Evidence

**Claim:** Optimizing your bedroom environment – ensuring it is dark, quiet, and comfortably cool – can significantly improve sleep quality.

**Evidence:** Both experimental and epidemiological studies support the impact of environment on sleep. Excessive heat or cold in the bedroom increases wakefulness and reduces restorative REM and slow-wave sleep(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3427038/). A sleep lab study found that raising bedroom temperature by even 1°C resulted in measurable decreases in sleep efficiency (more awakenings)(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360132324008369). On the other hand, a cool ambient temperature (~18°C or ~65°F) is associated with deeper sleep; this aligns with normal body temperature drop at night. Noise and light are similarly disruptive: Unexpected noises (e.g. traffic, notifications) can cause micro-arousals or awakenings, even if you don’t remember them. Light pollution in the bedroom (from streetlights or device screens) can suppress melatonin and fragment sleep. Importantly, a recent daily diary study in young adults identified “sleeping in a comfortable environment” as one of the top predictors of better self-reported sleep quality and efficiency(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34605392/). Official guidelines uniformly emphasize environmental control – the CDC explicitly recommends a quiet, dark, relaxing bedroom at a cool temperature for healthy sleep(https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html)(https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html).

**Citation:** Miller et al. (2022), *J. Clin. Sleep Med.*(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34605392/); CDC Sleep Guidelines (2024)(https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html)(https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html); Lan et al. (2018), *Sleep Med. Rev.* – ambient heat & sleep quality(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079224000194)(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079224000194).

**Protocol Relevance:** Turn your bedroom into a sleep sanctuary. Keep the room dark (use blackout shades or an eye mask, and eliminate or cover any electronic lights). Keep it quiet – consider earplugs, white noise machines, or fans to mask noise if you live in a noisy area. Keep it cool – most people sleep best around 60–67°F (15–19°C). Adjust bedding and pajamas accordingly (use breathable fabrics, add blankets you can remove, etc.). Also ensure your mattress and pillow are comfortable for you. These environmental tweaks reduce unnecessary awakenings and signal your body that it’s time for deep, uninterrupted sleep.

## Technology-Related Sleep Hygiene Interventions

### Reducing Evening Screen Time – Tier 1 Evidence

**Claim:** Cutting down on screen use in the evening (especially in the hour or two before bed) improves sleep quality and can help you fall asleep faster.

**Evidence:** A recent RCT in 111 young adults tested a “digital detox” – reducing smartphone use to <2 hours per day (with most reduction naturally in the evening hours) for 3 weeks – and found significant improvements in sleep. The intervention group had better post-intervention sleep quality scores than controls (Insomnia Severity Index improved by ~2.6 points)(https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-03944-z). Overall sleep quality showed a small-to-moderate improvement (η²≈0.05)(https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-03944-z). Another pilot RCT specifically targeting bedtime screen use (asking participants to avoid phone use for 30 minutes before bed) showed that after 4 weeks, the intervention group fell asleep ~9 minutes faster and slept longer than controls(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040492/). They also reported improved subjective sleep quality and less pre-sleep mental arousal(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040492/). These studies provide causal evidence that reducing screen time in the evening (when it’s most excessive for many) leads to better sleep outcomes. In addition, observational research on larger populations finds that each extra hour of screen time in the evening is associated with higher odds of insufficient sleep and symptoms of insomnia(https://sip2sleep.com/blogs/news/research-shows-phone-use-before-bed-increases-insomnia-risk-by-over-50-and-how-to-fix-it?srsltid=AfmBOoqaBuAV86_t03cMpu_okbAeLgNXra75ZR2234cTwCOuveWc9jLq)(https://sip2sleep.com/blogs/news/research-shows-phone-use-before-bed-increases-insomnia-risk-by-over-50-and-how-to-fix-it?srsltid=AfmBOoqaBuAV86_t03cMpu_okbAeLgNXra75ZR2234cTwCOuveWc9jLq). The mechanisms include both the displacement of sleep by engaging with devices (bedtime procrastination) and the alerting effect of screen light and stimulating content.

**Citation:** Pieh et al. (2025), *BMC Medicine*, DOI: 10.1186/s12916-025-03944-z(https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-03944-z); He et al. (2020), *PLoS ONE*, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0228756(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040492/); Exelmans & Van den Bulck (2016), *Soc. Sci. Med.*(https://sip2sleep.com/blogs/news/research-shows-phone-use-before-bed-increases-insomnia-risk-by-over-50-and-how-to-fix-it?srsltid=AfmBOoqaBuAV86_t03cMpu_okbAeLgNXra75ZR2234cTwCOuveWc9jLq).

**Protocol Relevance:** Institute an “electronics curfew” each night. For example, set a rule for yourself like “No phones, tablets, or TV after 10 PM” (or at least 30–60 minutes before your target bedtime). Use that wind-down time for non-screen activities (read a book, listen to calm music or podcasts, chat with a partner, etc.). By reclaiming that last hour of your day from screens, you’ll likely find it easier to transition to sleep at your desired bedtime. If you struggle with over-scrolling at night, consider apps or phone settings that limit usage (some phones can automatically disable apps at a set time). Consistency is key – over a few weeks, your brain adapts and you won’t miss the late-night screen time as your sleep improves.

### Blue-Light Filters and “Night Mode” Settings – Tier 2 Evidence (Limited Impact)

**Claim:** Dimming blue light from devices (using blue-light blocking glasses or night mode screen settings) is often suggested to help sleep, but by itself this yields only modest benefits for most people.

**Evidence:** The rationale behind blue-light filters is strong: blue wavelengths from screens suppress the body’s melatonin in the evening, potentially delaying sleepiness(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom). However, controlled trials have found mixed results on whether filtering blue light alone markedly improves sleep. A crossover RCT in healthy adults testing amber-tinted blue-blocking glasses (worn for 2 hours before bed) found no significant improvement in objective sleep duration or efficiency, despite a slight subjective reduction in awakenings(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33707105/)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33707105/). A 2023 Cochrane review of 17 trials concluded that blue-light filtering lenses probably make no meaningful difference in sleep quality in the general population(https://www.cochrane.org/about-us/news/blue-light-filtering-spectacles-probably-make-no-difference-eye-strain-eye-health-or-sleep)(https://www.cochrane.org/about-us/news/blue-light-filtering-spectacles-probably-make-no-difference-eye-strain-eye-health-or-sleep). One caveat: in people with insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, some studies have shown benefits to wearing blue-blocking glasses in the evening (improving melatonin onset and sleep, as an adjunct to therapy), but our focus is on individuals without diagnosed sleep disorders. Overall, reducing overall screen brightness and exposure time appears more effective than relying on night-mode tint alone.

**Citation:** Bigalke et al. (2021), *Sleep Health*, DOI: 10.1016/j.sleh.2021.02.004(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33707105/); Singh et al. (2023), *Cochrane Database Syst Rev*, DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD013559.pub2(https://www.cochrane.org/about-us/news/blue-light-filtering-spectacles-probably-make-no-difference-eye-strain-eye-health-or-sleep)(https://www.cochrane.org/about-us/news/blue-light-filtering-spectacles-probably-make-no-difference-eye-strain-eye-health-or-sleep).

**Protocol Relevance:** It’s still wise to use the “night mode” or blue-light filter on your devices after sunset – it may reduce eye strain and some alerting effect, and it signals you to move into evening mode. But don’t expect it to fully counteract the impact of late-night device use. Think of blue-light filters as a helpful supplement to, not a replacement for, the core strategy of cutting down evening screen time. If you need to use a device close to bedtime (e.g. for work), turn on night mode or use apps like f.lux, keep the brightness low, and view content in dark mode. These steps will at least minimize the harm by reducing overall light intensity and blue light emission, though a true break from screens is still superior for sleep.

### Keeping Devices Out of the Bedroom – Tier 2 Evidence

**Claim:** Removing smartphones and other devices from the bedroom (or at least keeping them silenced and away from the bed) leads to better sleep by eliminating distractions and temptation.

**Evidence:** A randomized trial in 2020 asked young adults to restrict mobile phone use in the 30 minutes before bedtime (essentially removing phone distraction at lights-out). After 4 weeks, those who implemented this had significantly longer sleep durations, fell asleep faster, and showed improved sleep quality on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index compared to controls(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040492/). Notably, they also reported reduced pre-sleep cognitive arousal (less “mind-racing”) and better mood in the mornings(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040492/). This suggests that simply not having the phone accessible at bedtime lowers both physical disruptions (no messages or scrolling) and mental stimulation. Large surveys also indicate a link between bedroom phone use and insomnia: e.g., a study of 45,000+ young adults found that those who never brought their phone to bed had significantly lower insomnia risk than those who frequently used phones in bed(https://sip2sleep.com/blogs/news/research-shows-phone-use-before-bed-increases-insomnia-risk-by-over-50-and-how-to-fix-it?srsltid=AfmBOoqaBuAV86_t03cMpu_okbAeLgNXra75ZR2234cTwCOuveWc9jLq). Sleep experts often observe that if a phone is on the nightstand, even if “silent,” people are tempted to check notifications if they wake at night(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom)(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom). This habit can lead to full awakening and difficulty returning to sleep.

**Citation:** He et al. (2020), *PLoS ONE*, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0228756(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040492/); Exelmans & Van den Bulck (2016), *Soc. Sci. Med.*(https://sip2sleep.com/blogs/news/research-shows-phone-use-before-bed-increases-insomnia-risk-by-over-50-and-how-to-fix-it?srsltid=AfmBOoqaBuAV86_t03cMpu_okbAeLgNXra75ZR2234cTwCOuveWc9jLq); Sleep Foundation – Tech in Bedroom Guidelines(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom)(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom).

**Protocol Relevance:** Treat your bedroom as a “screen-free zone” to the extent possible. Charge your phone overnight outside the bedroom (or at least across the room where you can’t reach it in bed). If you use your phone as an alarm, consider using a basic alarm clock instead(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom). The goal is to remove the cue and ability to mindlessly scroll or respond to messages when you should be sleeping. Many find that after an initial adjustment, not having the phone nearby vastly improves their sleep – they fall asleep quicker and if they do wake up at night, they can roll over and fall back asleep without the urge to check emails or social media. This change also eliminates the chance of late-night texts or alerts disturbing you. Making your bedroom a quiet, technology-free haven goes hand-in-hand with the other environmental improvements for optimal sleep.

### “Digital Curfew” and Notification Management – Tier 3 Evidence

**Claim:** Setting a strict cutoff time for interactive technology and silencing notifications at night can reduce sleep-disrupting alerts and help your mind disconnect from late-night stressors.

**Evidence:** Direct studies on notification curfews are still emerging, but the practice is grounded in basic sleep hygiene principles. The CDC and other health authorities advise turning off electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bedtime(https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html). By implication, this includes disabling notifications that could grab your attention. Sleep specialists note that the anticipation of messages (or habit of responsiveness) can keep the brain in an “alert” state. Surveys find that a significant proportion of people have had their sleep interrupted by phone notifications or calls; one poll by the National Sleep Foundation reported ~72% of children and 53% of adults keep a phone in the bedroom, often leading to nighttime disruptions (texts, notifications). While not an RCT, common sense and clinical observation suggest that a phone pinging at midnight for a non-urgent alert can jolt you from sleep. The Sleep Foundation recommends using Do Not Disturb or airplane mode overnight to prevent vibrations or lights from notifications(https://www.healthline.com/health-news/screen-time-bedtime-insomnia-risk)(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom). One small experimental report found that even knowing one’s phone is off (or notifications silenced) can reduce bedtime anxiety in those who feel pressure to be constantly available.

**Citation:** CDC Sleep Guidelines (2024)(https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html); Sleep Foundation (2020)(https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/technology-in-the-bedroom).

**Protocol Relevance:** Enforce a nightly “digital curfew.” For example, declare that after 10:30 PM, you will not respond to any work emails or social media – and communicate this boundary to colleagues and friends if needed. Set your smartphone to automatically go into Do Not Disturb mode during your sleep hours (many devices allow you to schedule this). This way, notifications will be silenced (or only very important contacts can get through, if you set exceptions for emergencies). By cutting off digital communications and alerts at a set time, you allow your mind to unwind without new stimuli. This practice pairs well with a bedtime routine – you might make 10:30 PM the time you switch the phone to silent and start reading or relaxing. The result is a quieter night both externally and internally, so you’re less likely to be startled awake and more likely to achieve the full, deep sleep you need.

### Summary – Key Pillars for a Sleep Optimization Protocol:

The research above suggests that the strongest evidence (Tier 1) supports a few fundamental behaviors: maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, exercising (but not too late in the day), and moderating substances like caffeine and alcohol that can impair sleep. Additionally, creating a conducive sleep environment (dark, cool, quiet bedroom) is highly effective. These core sleep hygiene practices set the stage for good sleep. Technology hygiene measures are a crucial modern addition: evidence is mounting that reducing evening screen time (digital detox) has measurable benefits for sleep and mental health(https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-03944-z)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040492/). While simply filtering blue light is not a magic bullet, combining multiple tech hygiene strategies – like removing devices from the bedroom and instituting a screen curfew – can eliminate common sources of sleep disruption.

When putting together a sleep optimization program for young adults, it’s best to treat tech hygiene as an integrated module within the overall behavioral plan, rather than an afterthought. Emphasize the “big four” pillars with the most robust support: (1) Regular schedule, (2) Controlled light exposure (morning bright light, dim at night), (3) Smart substance use (limit caffeine/alcohol), and (4) Reduced evening screen engagement. Around these, incorporate supporting habits like a relaxing bedtime routine, daily exercise (timed well), and a tech-free sleeping environment. By layering these strategies, participants can synergistically improve their sleep duration, quality, and daytime well-being. The interventions range from Tier 1 proven approaches to Tier 3 emerging tips, but together they form a comprehensive, behavior-based toolkit for optimizing sleep in an age of constant stimulation. Each individual may need to tailor specifics, but the evidence-based guidance above provides a strong starting framework for improving sleep naturally and sustainably.
