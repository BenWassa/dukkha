  strength: High
  scope: animal
  caveats: "Demonstrated in rodents with nearly complete dopamine loss still showing normal taste pleasure reactions; extreme dopamine loss is rare in humans."

  importance: High
  strength: High
  scope: animal
  caveats: "Shown in rat studies with accumbens dopamine stimulation; higher dopamine may also elevate general arousal but does not heighten core pleasure responses."

  importance: High
  strength: High
  scope: mixed
  caveats: "Addictive drugs initially produce euphoria, but with repeated use craving intensifies even as pleasurable effects wane; human evidence often relies on self-report and PET imaging."

  text: "Hedonic “liking” for rewards is generated by localized “hotspot” circuits (e.g. in nucleus accumbens shell and ventral pallidum) using neurotransmitters like opioids, distinct from the broad dopamine circuits for wanting."
  importance: Medium
  strength: High
  scope: animal
  caveats: "Identified in rodents via focal neurochemical manipulations; analogous hedonic networks in humans are presumed but harder to verify directly."

  text: "Human neuroimaging reveals that reward anticipation (wanting) activates dopamine-associated regions (ventral striatum), whereas the actual experience of pleasure (liking) engages other regions such as orbitofrontal cortex."
  importance: High
  strength: High
  scope: human
  caveats: "fMRI signals are indirect; ventral striatum activity can reflect prediction or salience, and orbitofrontal responses to pleasure can vary with context."
