## Wanting vs. Liking vs. Learning: Distinct Roles of the Brain’s Reward Systems

### Dissociable Components of Reward
Research has established three psychological components of reward – **“wanting” (incentive salience), “liking” (hedonic pleasure), and learning** – which correspond to distinct neural processes. “Wanting” refers to the motivational drive to obtain a reward, “liking” to the pleasurable impact of consuming the reward, and learning to the associations and predictions formed about rewards. These components normally occur together, but they are mediated by separable brain systems and can be experimentally dissociated.

### Dopamine and Incentive “Wanting”
**Mesolimbic dopamine** is a key neural substrate for “wanting” but not for “liking.” Dopamine projections from midbrain to nucleus accumbens attribute incentive salience to reward cues, invigorating the desire to pursue rewards. Classic studies using nearly complete dopamine depletions showed that eliminating dopamine abolishes motivated pursuit of rewards while sparing basic pleasure reactions: dopamine-deficient rats no longer work for food but still display normal liking orofacial expressions to sweet tastes. Conversely, increasing dopamine activity (e.g. via psychostimulants or direct accumbens stimulation) powerfully augments cue-triggered approach and effort for rewards **without enhancing hedonic facial “liking” reactions** to the reward itself.

### Hedonic “Liking” Circuits
Real pleasure “liking” is generated by a more restricted network of hedonic hotspots in the brain. Unlike dopamine’s widespread motivation circuit, hedonic hotspots are small subregions (identified in nucleus accumbens shell, ventral pallidum, brainstem, etc.) where certain neurochemical activations (e.g. mu-opioid, endocannabinoid) cause increases in positive “liking” reactions. Stimulating these hotspots amplifies sensory pleasure without requiring dopamine.

### Reward Prediction Errors and Learning
The third component, **learning**, is primarily driven by reward prediction error signals. Midbrain dopamine neurons exhibit phasic firing that encodes reward prediction errors: they fire bursts when rewards exceed expectation and pause when rewards are omitted. By broadcasting these signals, dopamine teaches the organism which cues and actions lead to unexpected rewards. Optogenetic experiments show that artificially mimicking dopamine prediction errors at specific moments is sufficient to induce new learning, establishing a causal role for dopamine in updating expectations.

### “Wanting” vs. “Liking” in Addiction and Human Studies
In addiction, the distinction between wanting and liking becomes clinically significant. Addictive drugs (or their cues) can trigger intense craving (“wanting”) even when drug euphoria (“liking”) is diminished. The Incentive-Sensitization Theory proposes that repeated drug use sensitizes mesolimbic dopamine circuitry, causing cues to evoke abnormally high “wanting” for the drug out of proportion to any pleasure obtained. Human PET studies show dopamine release correlating with compulsive drug wanting but not with liking. Event-related fMRI reveals that anticipation of reward activates ventral striatum, whereas reward outcomes engage orbitofrontal cortex and related regions.

### Pitfalls and Misconceptions
These advances correct earlier misconceptions. Dopamine should not be equated with pleasure: dopamine rises often reflect prediction or salience rather than hedonic impact, and reverse inference from brain activity to subjective pleasure is prone to error.

### Conclusion
The brain’s reward system is not unitary but a **triad of functions**: (1) learning signals (dopamine RPE bursts) tune predictions and reinforce behaviors; (2) “wanting” mechanisms (largely dopamine-driven) energize behavior toward incentives; and (3) “liking” mechanisms (hedonic hotspots) generate the subjective feelings of pleasure.
