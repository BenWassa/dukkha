  text: "Acute stress surges (e.g., via cortisol and noradrenaline) heighten dopaminergic “salience” signals for drug cues, leading to increased craving and drug-seeking."
  importance: High
  strength: High
  scope: mixed
  caveats: "Laboratory stress analogs (e.g., TSST) reliably provoke craving, but may not capture all real-world factors; individual variability in stress responses exists."

  text: "Chronic or repeated stress produces lasting dysregulation in stress and reward circuits (e.g., elevated CRF–dynorphin activity and blunted dopamine responses), fostering anhedonia and greater relapse vulnerability."
  importance: High
  strength: Medium
  scope: mixed
  caveats: "Human evidence is largely correlational; extrapolated from animal models of chronic stress-induced reward deficits; species differences and confounding life factors limit direct inference."

  text: "Stress exposure is a potent trigger for craving, and stress-induced craving often immediately precedes lapses or relapse episodes."
  importance: High
  strength: High
  scope: human
  caveats: "Demonstrated in prospective human studies; however, retrospective self-report can bias stress–relapse links."

  text: "Individuals with heightened stress reactivity or negative affect (e.g., high cortisol response, anxiety/PTSD) experience stronger cue-induced cravings and face elevated relapse risk."
  importance: Medium
  strength: Medium
  scope: human
  caveats: "Stress reactivity varies widely; e.g., patients with high withdrawal-related distress benefited most from stress-targeted treatment. Associations are correlational; causality is inferred but not definitively proven in humans."

  text: "Noradrenergic arousal mediates stress-related craving: pharmacologically dampening central noradrenaline (using α₁-blockers like prazosin or α₂-agonists like clonidine/lofexidine) reduces stress-induced craving and can improve abstinence outcomes."
  importance: High
  strength: Medium
  scope: human
  caveats: "Supported by pilot trials; effects may be specific to high-stress subgroups (e.g., those with severe withdrawal or comorbid PTSD). Medication side effects and adherence affect real-world utility."

  text: "HPA-axis modulation can alter craving: Elevated cortisol during stress correlates with higher craving, yet paradoxically, administering cortisol acutely can reduce drug-cue craving by impairing memory reconsolidation of drug cues."
  importance: Medium
  strength: Medium
  scope: human
  caveats: "Context-dependent effects: cortisol’s craving-reducing impact was seen in low-dependence cases and in controlled exposure settings. Not a standard treatment yet; longitudinal benefits and optimal dosing remain unclear."

  text: "Sleep disturbances (insomnia, reduced slow-wave sleep) are pervasive in recovery and independently predict stronger cravings and higher relapse risk."
  importance: High
  strength: High
  scope: human
  caveats: "Baseline insomnia and poor sleep continuity correlate with earlier relapse in alcohol use disorder. Causality is bidirectional—substance withdrawal disrupts sleep, and lack of restorative sleep elevates stress and impulsivity."

  text: "Targeting sleep early in treatment (through sleep hygiene or therapy) can lower stress and improve self-regulation, potentially reducing relapse likelihood, although direct evidence for long-term relapse prevention is still emerging."
  importance: High
  strength: Medium
  scope: human
  caveats: "Small trials of insomnia treatment in SUD show improved sleep and next-day mood, but mixed impact on 3–6 month relapse rates. Poor adherence to sleep interventions can limit efficacy."

  text: "Regular physical exercise attenuates stress and craving: acute moderate exercise reliably reduces momentary drug cravings, and exercise-based programs modestly improve mood and increase abstinence rates in SUD patients."
  importance: Medium
  strength: High
  scope: human
  caveats: "Consistent acute effects on craving are reported; however, sustaining exercise long-term is challenging, and not all studies show significant improvements in sustained abstinence (effects often modest, e.g., OR≈1.7)."

  text: "Mindfulness-based interventions (e.g., meditation, breathwork) reduce stress reactivity and help manage cravings. In RCTs, mindfulness training (MBRP) significantly lowered relapse risk and days of use compared to standard relapse prevention."
  importance: High
  strength: High
  scope: human
  caveats: "Mindfulness requires active patient engagement; while multiple trials report benefits, some outcomes (e.g., time to first lapse) may be comparable to cognitive-behavioral approaches. Optimal integration (group vs. individual format) is under study."
