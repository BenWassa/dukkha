# Visual Assets Documentation for AI Image Generation

## Overview
This document catalogs visual assets in the Dukkha project that are candidates for replacement with **metaphorical, situational AI-generated images**. Rather than recreating diagrams, we'll create artistic moments and metaphors that embody the psychological principles through visual storytelling.

## Current Visual Assets → Metaphorical Replacements

### 1. Ping/Scroll Loop → **Digital Temptation Metaphors**

#### notification_scroll_loop.svg → **"The Bulging Phone"**
**Current:** Cyclical flowchart of digital distraction cycle  
**New Vision:** Metaphorical image capturing compulsive urge and content pressure

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Create a surreal, artistic image of a smartphone wrapped in tight leather straps, bulging and expanding against the restraints. The phone's screen glows intensely with notifications and content spilling out like liquid light. Show the straps straining, the phone's form distorting as if it's about to burst from internal pressure. Use dramatic lighting and shadows to convey urgency and containment. Dark, moody atmosphere with the phone as the central, almost living entity.
```

**Alternative Concepts:**
- Phone as a "pressure cooker" with steam escaping through cracks
- Phone morphing into a pulsating, organic form with digital veins
- Phone as a "black hole generator" creating gravitational pull in a room

#### ping_scroll_loop v2.0.svg → **"Moth to Flame"**
**Current:** Enhanced flowchart with intervention points  
**New Vision:** People drawn irresistibly to digital light

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Illustrate a dramatic scene of people walking through a dark urban environment, all irresistibly drawn toward a glowing smartphone held by one person. Show multiple figures in silhouette, their faces illuminated by the phone's light, walking toward it like moths to a flame. Capture the magnetic pull - some reaching out, others with outstretched hands, all compelled by the digital glow. Use cinematic lighting with the phone as the sole light source in an otherwise dark scene.
```

#### ping_scroll_loop_original.svg → **"Digital Siren Call"**
**Current:** Basic loop structure  
**New Vision:** Phone as irresistible, almost supernatural attractor

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Create an artistic composition showing a smartphone as a mesmerizing digital siren. Depict ethereal light beams emanating from the screen, wrapping around and pulling toward it like invisible tendrils. Show subtle human silhouettes in the background, partially formed from light particles, being drawn into the phone's glow. Use flowing, organic lines and a dreamlike quality to represent the compulsive attraction.
```

### 2. Dopamine Curve → **Reward & Crash Metaphors**

#### dopamine_baseline_spike.svg → **"The Dopamine Crash"**
**Current:** Scientific line graph of dopamine dynamics  
**New Vision:** Physical manifestation of the reward crash cycle

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Visualize the dopamine crash as a person standing on a precarious platform that suddenly drops beneath them. Show the initial high as they're lifted up by glowing energy, then the sudden fall as the platform collapses, leaving them suspended in empty space. Use contrasting lighting - bright, euphoric glow at the peak, then stark darkness in the crash. Include subtle digital elements (notifications, screens) integrated into the physical scene.
```

#### simple dopamine case process.svg → **"Sugar Rush Drop"**
**Current:** Simplified dopamine process  
**New Vision:** Physical metaphor of temporary high followed by depletion

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Create a metaphorical image of a person consuming digital content like a sugary substance. Show them in a state of initial euphoria, glowing with energy, then transitioning to a depleted, slumped posture as the "sugar rush" wears off. Use food/drink metaphors - perhaps holding a glowing digital "candy" that dissolves into emptiness. Capture the physical toll with slumped shoulders, drained expression, and fading light.
```

### 3. Stress-Sensitization Loop → **Escalating Pressure Metaphors**

#### stress_sensitization_loop.svg → **"The Tightening Coil"**
**Current:** Descending flowchart of stress amplification  
**New Vision:** Physical manifestation of tightening psychological pressure

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Depict a person wrapped in tightening digital cables or wires that constrict around them like a python. Show the wires emanating from a smartphone, coiling tighter with each interaction. Capture the escalating tension - initial loose connections becoming painfully tight. Use metallic, technological elements mixed with organic human form to show the fusion of digital and psychological pressure.
```

#### stress_sensitization_loop_pic.png → **"Digital Quicksand"**
**Current:** Raster version of stress loop  
**New Vision:** Person sinking into digital quicksand

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Illustrate a person sinking into a pool of glowing digital quicksand made of app icons, notifications, and screen fragments. Show them initially standing firm, then progressively sinking as the digital elements pull them down. Use depth and perspective to convey the sinking motion, with the person's expression showing initial resistance turning to resignation. Dark, ominous atmosphere with the digital elements as both attractive and destructive.
```

### 4. Reward Compass → **Motivational State Metaphors**

#### reward_compass.svg → **"The Four Rooms"**
**Current:** 2x2 matrix for self-assessment  
**New Vision:** Four distinct psychological environments

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Create a surreal architectural visualization of four interconnected rooms representing different motivational states. Show:
- "Low Drive/Anhedonia": A dim, empty room with faded colors and a slumped figure
- "Compulsive Seeking/Burnout": A chaotic room with flickering screens and exhausted figure
- "Optimal Flow/Contentment": A bright, harmonious room with balanced light and peaceful figure (highlighted)
- "High Spikes/Low Sensitivity": A stark room with intense, overwhelming light and agitated figure
Use architectural metaphors to represent psychological states, with doors connecting the rooms.
```

### 5. Mermaid Diagrams → **Interactive Digital Ecosystems**

#### Untitled-1.mmd → **"The Digital Web"**
**Current:** Machine-readable diagram specification  
**New Vision:** Person entangled in digital connection web

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Visualize a person at the center of a complex web of digital connections. Show glowing threads emanating from their phone, wrapping around their body and extending outward to connect with other devices and people in the distance. Depict the web as both beautiful and constricting - luminous and attractive, yet binding. Use light trails and particle effects to show the flow of digital energy through the network.
```

#### ping_scroll.mmd → **"The Notification Storm"**
**Current:** Enhanced Mermaid diagram  
**New Vision:** Person weathering a storm of digital notifications

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Create a dramatic scene of a person standing in a storm of digital notifications. Show notifications as physical raindrops or snowflakes made of light, falling heavily around them. Depict the person shielding themselves or being buffeted by the storm, with some notifications breaking through their defenses. Use weather metaphors - lightning flashes from screen brightness, wind from notification urgency - to convey the overwhelming nature of digital bombardment.
```
