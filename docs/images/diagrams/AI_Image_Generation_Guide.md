- Intervention exit points
- Downward visual flow
- Highlighted dopamine spike node

**AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Design a psychological flowchart showing a stress-sensitization cycle. Create 6 interconnected nodes in a descending spiral pattern representing escalating stress and maladaptive coping. Include intervention points as off-ramps. Use a downward trajectory to convey the spiral effect. Highlight the reward-seeking phase and contrast it with clear exit strategies. Professional, insightful aesthetic.
```

#### stress_sensitization_loop_pic.png
