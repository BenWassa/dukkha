## ARTISTIC VISION
### 1. Diagram: The Ping/Scroll Loop (attention.html)

**Visual Vision:** Imagine a sleek, minimalist dance, a continuous, self-reinforcing circle of digital allure. This diagram aims to depict the nearly unbreakable grip of digital distraction, a smooth, flowing cycle that can only be interrupted by conscious, deliberate acts of disengagement. It should feel clean, modern, and abstract, yet instantly recognizable as the rhythm of our daily digital lives.

**Key Visual Elements:**

*   **Nodes:** Five to six distinct, soft-edged rectangular shapes, like polished stones, are arranged in a harmonious circle or a graceful oval. Each node represents a stage in the distraction journey.
*   **Loop Flow:** Silken, graceful arcs, like currents in a stream, connect these nodes, guiding the eye effortlessly through the cycle. The general flow is depicted by a muted, subtle secondary color, a quiet whisper of progression. However, as the loop leads into the "Anticipation & Craving" node – the moment of the dopamine hit – this connecting arrow pulses with a vibrant accent color, a visual exclamation mark highlighting the reward.
*   **Highlight Node:** The "Anticipation & Craving (Dopamine Spike)" node stands out prominently. It's filled with the diagram's vibrant accent color, a beacon of reward, with its text etched in a crisp background white for striking contrast.
*   **Intervention Points:** These are the diagram's moments of hope. They appear as smaller, distinct rounded rectangles or gentle pill shapes, positioned strategically outside the main loop. They are like inviting "off-ramps" from a highway, connected to the main cycle by thin, dashed lines. These delicate lines symbolize a conscious severance from the typical flow, a chosen break.
*   **Typography:** All text, both within the clean nodes and alongside the flowing arrows, employs a modern, sans-serif typeface, ensuring crystal-clear readability and a contemporary feel.
*   **Overall Coloring:** The entire visual unfolds against a pristine background white, with the main nodes presented in a slightly elevated, soft gray, outlined by a whisper-thin border. This creates a sense of meticulous, deliberate design.

### 2. Diagram: Dopamine Baseline vs. Spike (recovery.html, model.html)

**Visual Vision:** Envision a precise, almost clinical, yet elegantly simple line graph. Its purpose is to lay bare the fundamental dynamics of dopamine within us. It must unequivocally show our steady, resting dopamine state, the sudden, exhilarating surge in response to pleasure, and the subsequent, often overlooked, compensatory dip below our usual level, followed by a gentle, natural return. The visual should emanate an aura of authority and clarity, devoid of any visual noise.

**Key Visual Elements:**

*   **Axes:** Two slender, unassuming lines form the graph's foundation – a horizontal "Time" axis and a vertical "Dopamine Level (Relative)" axis. They are drawn in a subtle, muted color, almost receding into the background, with delicate arrows at their ends indicating progression.
*   **Baseline:** A distinct, horizontal dashed line, like a quiet heartbeat, runs across the graph, signifying the "Baseline." It too uses the muted text color, clearly labeled to anchor the viewer's understanding.
*   **Dopamine Curve:** This is the heart of the illustration. A singular, bold, and gracefully arcing line, crafted with smooth, elegant curves (Bezier curves), vividly tells the story:
    *   It begins calmly, resting on the baseline.
    *   It then leaps upward in a sharp, rapid ascent to a towering peak—the visual representation of a "spike."
    *   Following the peak, it plunges noticeably below the baseline, revealing the critical "trough."
    *   Finally, it embarks on a gentle, gradual upward curve, softly returning towards the calm of the baseline.
    *   This crucial curve and its corresponding label, "Dopamine Level," are rendered in the diagram's vibrant accent color, drawing the eye and emphasizing its significance.
*   **Typography:** All labels, including the axes, the baseline, and the curve itself, are presented in a clean, sans-serif font, ensuring that scientific precision is communicated with effortless readability.
*   **Overall Coloring:** The graph rests serenely on a slightly elevated gray background, encased within a slender, framed box, reinforcing a sense of premium quality and the feel of a valuable guidebook.

### 3. Diagram: Stress-Sensitization Loop (with Exit Points) (recovery.html)

**Visual Vision:** This diagram is designed to illuminate a detrimental spiral—a feedback loop where the pressures of stress ignite unhelpful coping mechanisms, which in turn drain our inner reserves and intensify our stress, pushing us further downward. Crucially, it also offers a clear, hopeful visual narrative: specific, proactive interventions presented as "exit points" that can decisively break this negative cycle. It aims to feel professional, insightful, and ultimately, empowering.

**Key Visual Elements:**

*   **Main Loop Nodes:** Smoothly rounded rectangular nodes, like steps in a descending staircase, represent the various stages of this stress-driven journey (e.g., "Stress / Anxiety," "Attention on Quick Rewards," "Impulse / Reward-Seeking"). They are arranged in a clear, possibly elongated vertical loop, drawing the viewer into the cycle.
*   **Loop Flow:** Solid, flowing curved arrows gracefully connect these nodes, visually depicting the reinforcing progression of the cycle. These arrows use a subtle secondary color, a quiet guide through the downward path. Within this loop, the "Brief Relief (Dopamine Spike)" node stands out, glowing with the vibrant accent color and its text in crisp background white, highlighting the fleeting, yet addictive, nature of the reward.
*   **Exit Points:** These are the diagram's vital message of hope. They are visually distinct—perhaps soft ovals or pill-shaped nodes—positioned purposefully *outside* the main loop. They are tethered to relevant points in the cycle by thin, dashed lines, like lifelines thrown to break the pattern. These connections beautifully symbolize the interruption of the negative pattern, offering a pathway out.
*   **Labels:** All nodes feature clear, concise text. The intervention labels, such as "Exit: Breathwork" or "Exit: Exercise," are direct and empowering. All text uses a modern sans-serif typeface, ensuring clarity and professionalism.
*   **Overall Coloring:** The main nodes are rendered in a slightly elevated gray with subtle border strokes, giving them a grounded feel. The empowering exit nodes, however, could gently differentiate themselves with a slightly lighter surface color and border, featuring text in the primary, commanding text color, subtly signaling their beneficial nature.

### 4. Diagram: The Reward Compass (model.html)

**Visual Vision:** Envision a clean, intuitive, and highly functional 2x2 matrix, or a four-quadrant map. This diagram is designed as a "compass" or "map" for the reward system, providing a high-level snapshot of one's motivational and emotional landscape. Its ultimate purpose is to help users identify their current state and, ideally, guide them towards an "optimal" zone of well-being.

**Key Visual Elements:**

*   **Axes:** Two intersecting lines, like the crosshairs of a compass, divide the space into four distinct quadrants. The horizontal axis speaks to "Spike vs. Sensitivity" – suggesting a spectrum from feeling desensitized with high spikes on one end, to being highly sensitive with low spikes on the other. The vertical axis represents "Dopamine Baseline Level," ranging from low to high. These axis lines are drawn in a muted, understated color, allowing the quadrants themselves to take center stage.
*   **Quadrant Zones:** Each of the four quadrants possesses a unique, subtle background fill, like gentle washes of color (perhaps alternating light and slightly elevated grays with a touch of transparency). This layering provides clear visual distinction without being overpowering.
*   **Quadrant Labels:** Clear and concise text labels each zone, such as "Low Drive / Anhedonia," "Compulsive Seeking / Burnout," "Optimal Flow / Contentment," and "High Spikes / Low Sensitivity." These labels are rendered in a muted text color, suggesting a quiet, insightful diagnosis of each state.
*   **Optimal Zone Highlight:** The "Optimal Flow / Contentment" quadrant is the desired destination and is visually celebrated. It might be framed with a subtle border in the diagram's vibrant accent color, or adorned with a small, evocative icon in that same accent hue, drawing the eye to the ideal state.
*   **Central Motif:** At the very heart of the intersecting axes lies a subtle, compass-like graphic element—perhaps a simple circle with crosshairs—rendered in the vibrant accent color against the background white. This central emblem reinforces the "compass" metaphor, signaling guidance and direction.
*   **Typography:** All labels and text elements throughout the compass use a clean, modern sans-serif typeface, ensuring clarity and a professional feel.
*   **Overall Coloring:** The diagram is firmly rooted in a sophisticated, neutral palette. The vibrant accent color is used judiciously and purposefully, reserved for highlighting the optimal state and reinforcing the central metaphor of a guiding compass.

## RESEARCH ENRICHMENT
### 1. Diagram: The Ping/Scroll Loop (attention.html)

**Visual Vision:** Imagine a sleek, minimalist, and almost hypnotically cyclical diagram that reveals the anatomy of digital distraction. It's not just a flowchart; it's a visual metaphor for the "vicious cycle" of engagement, a neurobiological trap that feels "below the level of conscious decision-making" and, as such, nearly uncontrollable. This diagram is designed to be a clean, modern, and slightly abstract representation of this "inescapable loop," yet it must resonate immediately with the user's daily experience of auto-piloted digital behavior. It embodies the "engine engineered high," a relentless, self-reinforcing rhythm.

**Key Visual Elements:**

*   **Nodes:** Five to six distinct, soft-edged rectangular forms, like smooth pebbles in a stream, are arranged in a clear, flowing circle or an elegant oval. These nodes are labeled with concise, psychologically resonant text – such as "Ping / Notification Received," "Curiosity / Urge to Check," "Anticipation & Craving (Dopamine Spike)," "Scrolling / Consumption," and "Brief Satisfaction / Habit Reinforcement." They represent the automatic, spontaneous steps of this habit.
*   **Loop Flow:** Smooth, graceful arcs, akin to currents propelling a mechanism, connect these nodes, clearly indicating the progression of the distraction cycle. These arrows flow with a subtle secondary color (represented by `var(--color-text-secondary)`), signifying the general, often unnoticed, momentum of the loop. However, the arrow leading directly into the "Anticipation & Craving" node – the very moment of the brain's "want" signal, the "engineered high" – subtly pulsates with the accent color (denoted by `var(--color-accent)`), visually emphasizing the powerful, unpredictable reward mechanism at play, much like the compelling central element in the referenced "dopamine reward loop diagram."
*   **Highlight Node:** The "Anticipation & Craving (Dopamine Spike)" node is the diagram's magnetic focal point. It's boldly filled with the accent color (`var(--color-accent)`), a beacon of the brain's "want" signal, with its text etched in the crisp background white (`var(--color-background)`) for striking contrast and immediate recognition.
*   **Intervention Points:** These are the diagram's crucial counterpoints, offering a powerful visual antithesis to the loop's "inescapable" nature. They appear as smaller, distinct rounded rectangles or gentle pill shapes, positioned strategically outside the main loop. These are the "off-ramps," symbolizing "deliberate acts of agency" like "pausing and noticing" or "grounding yourself." They connect to the main loop via thin, dashed lines (depicted by `var(--color-text-muted)`), a delicate visual metaphor for a conscious break in the standard, automatic flow, much like breaking a feedback mechanism in the "behavioral control theory flowchart."
*   **Typography:** All text within the nodes and on the arrows utilizes a clean, modern sans-serif typeface (represented by `var(--font-sans)`), ensuring clarity and optimal readability at clear font sizes.
*   **Overall Coloring:** The entire visual unfolds against a pristine background white (`var(--color-background)`), creating a crisp, clean canvas. The main nodes are rendered in a slightly elevated, soft gray (`var(--color-surface-elevated)`), outlined by whisper-thin border strokes (`var(--color-border)`), imbuing the design with a sense of clean, deliberate design, consistent with a premium guidebook aesthetic.

### 2. Diagram: Dopamine Baseline vs. Spike (recovery.html, model.html)

**Visual Vision:** This diagram is conceived as a precise, scientific, and profoundly minimalist line graph, laying bare the foundational concepts of dopamine dynamics. It's a narrative of neurobiological regulation and dysregulation, designed to feel authoritative and clean, free from any visual clutter. It clearly illustrates the stable, healthy "baseline" dopamine, the sharp, exhilarating "spike" in response to reward, and crucially, the compensatory dip below baseline that follows, leading to a state of "tolerance," where "more and more is needed to get less and less."

**Key Visual Elements:**

*   **Axes:** Two slender, subtle lines form the graph's essential structure: a horizontal X-axis labeled "Time" and a vertical Y-axis labeled "Dopamine Level (Relative)." These lines are drawn in a muted, understated color (represented by `var(--color-text-muted)`), receding gracefully to allow the curve to dominate, with delicate arrows at their ends indicating direction.
*   **Baseline:** A distinct horizontal dashed line, like a calm horizon, signifies the "Baseline." It uses the same subtle muted color (`var(--color-text-muted)`) and is clearly labeled, serving as a critical reference point for understanding the subsequent fluctuations.
*   **Dopamine Curve:** This is the diagram's most compelling element, a singular, prominent, and smoothly curved line (designed with elegant Bezier curves). It vividly narrates the brain's dopamine response:
    *   It begins serenely, resting upon the baseline.
    *   It then surges upward in a sharp, rapid ascent to a high peak—the "spike."
    *   Following this peak, it plunges noticeably below the baseline, creating a clear trough that embodies the "compensatory fall" and the state where individuals might use substances "just to get normal."
    *   Finally, it embarks on a gradual, gentle upward curve, a visual representation of the arduous but hopeful journey of "neurological recovery," taking months to return to a "semblance of normalcy." This graceful ascent offers "realistic hope," validating the persistence required for restoring a healthy baseline.
    *   This crucial curve and its accompanying label, "Dopamine Level," are rendered in the vibrant accent color (denoted by `var(--color-accent)`), ensuring visual emphasis and direct connection to the "scientific dopamine activity graph" used as a reference.
*   **Typography:** All labels—on the axes, the baseline, and the curve itself—are presented in a clear, sans-serif font (represented by `var(--font-sans)`), with appropriate font sizes for optimal readability, reinforcing the scientific authority of the visualization.
*   **Overall Coloring:** The graph rests cleanly upon a slightly elevated gray background (represented by `var(--color-surface-elevated)`), encased within a slender border framed box (defined by `var(--color-border)`). This structured presentation reinforces the premium, guidebook feel and conveys scientific authority through its precision and minimalism.

### 3. Diagram: Stress-Sensitization Loop (with Exit Points) (recovery.html)

**Visual Vision:** This diagram aims to illustrate a detrimental feedback loop, a "downward spiral" where stress intensifies maladaptive coping, depleting internal resources and amplifying anxiety. It embodies the "stress sensitization" theory and "Kindling Hypothesis," visually suggesting how repeated exposure to stress can lead to increasing vulnerability, making individuals sensitive to even minor stressors. Crucially, the diagram also provides a clear, hopeful visual narrative: specific, actionable interventions depicted as "exit points" that decisively break this negative cycle. It's designed to feel professional, insightful, and powerfully empowering, contrasting the chaotic spiral with moments of agency.

**Key Visual Elements:**

*   **Main Loop Nodes:** Rounded rectangular nodes, like steps spiraling downward, represent the stages of this stress-driven cycle (e.g., "Stress / Anxiety," "Attention on Quick Rewards," "Impulse / Reward-Seeking," "Brief Relief," "Baseline Drops," "More Stress"). They are arranged in a clear, potentially elongated vertical loop that subtly descends across the page, visually suggesting a "tightening, inescapable vortex" of escalating vulnerability, much like the "stress feedback loop diagram" and "PTSD feedback loop diagram" illustrate cyclical negative patterns.
*   **Loop Flow:** Solid, smooth curved arrows gracefully connect these nodes, visually depicting the reinforcing progression of the cycle. These arrows are drawn in a subtle secondary color (represented by `var(--color-text-secondary)`), guiding the eye through the escalating pattern. Within this loop, the "Brief Relief (Dopamine Spike)" node stands out, glowing with the vibrant accent color (`var(--color-accent)`) and its text in crisp background white (`var(--color-background)`), creating a direct visual link to the dopamine dynamics discussed in previous diagrams and highlighting the short-lived, yet compulsive, relief found in maladaptive coping.
*   **Exit Points:** These are the diagram's vital message of empowerment and hope. They are visually distinct – perhaps soft ovals or inviting pill-shaped nodes – positioned purposefully *outside* the main loop. They represent "conscious choices" and "acts of agency," such as "grounding yourself" or "taking small actions," that oppose the automaticity of the loop. They are tethered to relevant points in the main cycle by thin, dashed lines (depicted by `var(--color-text-muted)`), like lifelines thrown to break a pattern. These connections beautifully symbolize the interruption of the negative feedback loop.
*   **Labels:** All nodes feature clear, concise text. The intervention labels (e.g., "Exit: Breathwork," "Exit: Exercise," "Exit: Healthy Connection") are direct and actionable. All text uses a modern sans-serif typeface (represented by `var(--font-sans)`), ensuring clarity and professional communication.
*   **Overall Coloring:** The main loop nodes are rendered in a slightly elevated gray (`var(--color-surface-elevated)`) with subtle border strokes (`var(--color-border)`), grounding them visually. The empowering exit nodes, however, gently differentiate themselves with a slightly lighter surface color (`var(--color-surface)`) and border stroke (`var(--color-border)`), featuring text in the primary, commanding text color (`var(--color-text-primary)`), subtly signaling their beneficial and active role in breaking the cycle. This contrasting visual style reinforces the user's ability to find agency and offers a hopeful path out of the spiral.

It synthesizes complex scientific models into a personal, self-assessment tool.

**Key Visual Elements:**

*   **Axes:** Two intersecting lines, like the crosshairs of a precise compass, divide the space into four distinct quadrants. The horizontal X-axis represents "Spike vs. Sensitivity," encompassing "Desensitized/High Spikes" on one end and "Highly Sensitive/Low Spikes" on the other—a direct translation of the core problem from the Ping/Scroll Loop. The vertical Y-axis represents "Dopamine Baseline Level," ranging from "Low" at the bottom to "High" at the top, directly summarizing the concept from the Dopamine Curve diagram. These axis lines are drawn in a muted, understated color (represented by `var(--color-text-muted)`), allowing the quadrants themselves to be the focus.
*   **Quadrant Zones:** Each of the four quadrants possesses a unique, subtle background fill, like gentle, layered washes of color (alternating `var(--color-surface)` and `var(--color-surface-elevated)` with an implied opacity for visual depth). This clear visual distinction allows for easy identification of the four distinct psychological states.
*   **Quadrant Labels:** Clear, concise text labels each zone, such as "Low Drive / Anhedonia" (reflecting apathy and depression from low dopamine baseline), "Compulsive Seeking / Burnout" (the "addicted brain" caught in the dopamine crash loop), "Optimal Flow / Contentment," and "High Spikes / Low Sensitivity." These labels are rendered in a muted text color (represented by `var(--color-text-muted)`), offering quiet, insightful diagnoses of each state. The overall aesthetic aligns with the clean 2x2 quadrant design seen in the "RCVE Project Prioritization Matrix."
*   **Optimal Zone Highlight:** The "Optimal Flow / Contentment" quadrant is the diagram's aspirational destination and is visually celebrated. It is subtly emphasized, perhaps with a distinct border or a small, uplifting icon rendered in the vibrant accent color (denoted by `var(--color-accent)`), transforming it from a mere label into a clear visual goal, similar to the "Prioritize" section in the referenced matrix.
*   **Central Motif:** At the very heart of the intersecting axes lies a subtle, compass-like graphic element—a simple circle with precise crosshairs—rendered in the vibrant accent color (`var(--color-accent)`) against the background white (`var(--color-background)`). This central emblem powerfully reinforces the "compass" metaphor, signaling guidance, navigation, and intentional movement towards the optimal state.
*   **Typography:** All labels and text elements throughout the compass use a clean, modern sans-serif typeface (represented by `var(--font-sans)`), ensuring clarity and a professional feel.
