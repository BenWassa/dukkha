**Why this works (quick):** Variable rewards inflate prediction error → compulsive checking.

{{ protocol_steps(steps=[
  "Inventory triggers: list top 3 variable-reward apps/sites.",
  "Remove for 48h: uninstall or block; mute all notifications.",
  "Replace: pre-plan alternatives (walk, call a friend, read).",
  "Breathing windows: 2× daily, 5 minutes each during peak urges.",
  "Reintroduce selectively: after 48h, time-box and disable infinite scroll."
]) }}
