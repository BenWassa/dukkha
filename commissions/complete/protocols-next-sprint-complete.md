# Sprint Complete: Convert Protocol MDs → Styled HTML pages + Index

Date: 2025-08-20
Completed: 2025-08-20
Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully implemented LLM-executable sprint to convert canonical Markdown protocols from `research/protocol expansions/` into styled HTML pages under `docs/site/protocols/`, generated index (`docs/site/protocols.html`), appended safe CSS rules, and inserted compact `<details>` summaries into topic pages. All acceptance criteria met.

## Deliverables Created
- `scripts/build_protocols.py` — Python converter script (with template replacement fix)
- 6 generated HTML pages in `docs/site/protocols/` with full content
- `docs/site/protocols.html` — index page listing all protocols with summaries
- `docs/site/protocols/manifest.json` — metadata manifest
- CSS rules appended to `docs/styles.css` for protocol styling
- `<details>` snippets inserted into `docs/site/attention.html` and `docs/site/recovery.html`

## Validation Results
All validation checks passed:
- Generated protocol pages contain actual titles, summaries, and content (not placeholders)
- Index includes entries for all 6 protocols with correct links
- Details snippets present in both topic pages with correct IDs and hrefs
- CSS styling applied and functional
- Internal links validate
- No errors reported in JSON report

## Technical Notes
- Fixed template replacement issue: changed from `{{TITLE}}` to `{TITLE}` tokens in script
- Script is idempotent and can be re-run safely
- Generated pages use site CSS and match design system
- Mobile responsive design maintained
