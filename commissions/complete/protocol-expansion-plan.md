# Protocol Expansion Plan - Project Dukkha

Based on research assessment, we have strong evidence for 6 out of 7 proposed protocols. Here's the development roadmap:

## Immediate Development (Strong Evidence Base)

### 3. Digital Detox Protocol (3-Day Experiment)
**Evidence Sources:** R2, R5
**Key Interventions:**
- Batch notifications to 3×/day (Fitz et al. 2019)
- Grayscale mode implementation (Holte et al. 2020)
- App icon removal/desaturation (Olson et al. 2022)
- Context-sensitive friction implementation (Meinhardt et al. 2025)

### 4. Sleep Optimization Protocol (14-Day Experiment)
**Evidence Sources:** R4, R7 PDF
**Key Interventions:**
- Consistent wake-up anchor and sleep timing
- Morning sunlight exposure for circadian entrainment
- Evening wind-down ritual
- Sleep environment optimization
- CBT-I techniques for insomnia

### 5. Stress Management Protocol (10-Day Experiment)
**Evidence Sources:** R4
**Key Interventions:**
- Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) techniques
- Diaphragmatic breathing for vagal tone
- Acute exercise for momentary craving reduction (20-30% effect)
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Heart rate variability training

### 6. Mindfulness & Awareness Protocol (21-Day Experiment)
**Evidence Sources:** R3, R4
**Key Interventions:**
- Buddhist-informed urge surfing techniques
- Distinguishing taṇhā (craving) from chanda (wholesome desire)
- Daily mindfulness practice for limbic down-regulation
- Craving observation without reactivity
- Metacognitive awareness training

## Research Needed

### 7. Nutrition & Supplementation Protocol
**Evidence Gaps:**
- Specific dopamine precursor research (tyrosine, L-DOPA)
- Circadian eating patterns and reward sensitivity
- Micronutrient deficiencies affecting dopamine synthesis
- Anti-inflammatory diet effects on mood and motivation

**Research Run Needed:** Focus on nutrition interventions for dopamine optimization

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate:** Digital Detox (easiest to implement, clear evidence)
2. **High Priority:** Sleep Optimization (fundamental for all other protocols)
3. **Medium Priority:** Stress Management (builds on recovery reset)
4. **Medium Priority:** Mindfulness & Awareness (philosophical foundation)
5. **Future:** Nutrition Protocol (requires additional research)

## Integration Strategy

Each protocol should:
- Stand alone as a focused experiment
- Reference and build upon previous protocols
- Include specific intervention points based on research
- Provide measurable outcomes and tracking methods
- Include safety considerations and contraindications

## Next Steps

1. Develop Digital Detox Protocol first (strongest evidence, easiest implementation)
2. Extract specific interventions from R4 for Stress Management Protocol
3. Synthesize R3 Buddhist concepts with R4 mindfulness research for Awareness Protocol
4. Conduct nutrition research run for final protocol
5. Update index page claim once we have 5+ protocols developed
