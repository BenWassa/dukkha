# Commission (complete): Protocols Index + Inline Collapsible Summaries (Option 1)

Date: 2025-08-20
Source: `commission_protocols_option1.md` (moved here)

## Summary

Deterministic, LLM-executable commissioning document to implement Option 1: a single `protocols.html` index page plus lightweight, collapsible `<details>` protocol summaries embedded in topic pages (e.g., `attention.html`, `recovery.html`). Keeps site pages lean while making canonical protocol content discoverable from `research/protocol expansions/*.md`.

## Acceptance criteria (from original)

- `docs/site/protocols.html` exists and lists protocol titles with 1â€“2 sentence summaries and links to canonical MDs.
- Topic pages show collapsed summaries linking to full protocols.
- Site navigation contains a visible `Protocols` link.
- Visual layout matches site style and remains single-column where appropriate.
- All inserted internal links point to existing files/anchors.
