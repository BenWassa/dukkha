# Focus & Attention (attention_skeleton.md)

## Thesis

In an era of ubiquitous digital distractions designed to hijack our reward systems, sustained focus and deep work are increasingly challenging. By understanding how dopamine drives our attention and by implementing strategic interventions, modern professionals can reclaim their focus, enhance productivity, and cultivate a more intentional relationship with technology.

## Core Claims (Choose 3 from claims.yaml to expand upon)

### Claim 1: Novelty and unpredictable rewards hijack attention via dopamine, leading to compulsive digital checking.

*   **Evidence Chip:** Brain's reward circuit releases dopamine for unpredicted rewards, making novel cues (notifications, new posts) irresistibly salient. This mechanism is exploited by variable reward schedules in apps, driving persistent checking behavior. [R1-C01, R1-C08, R2-C01, R2-C03, R2-C05]
*   **Narrative Angle:** Explores how apps leverage our inherent brain wiring for novelty and unpredictable reward to create addictive "checking habits."

### Claim 2: The distinction between 'wanting' (dopamine-driven craving) and 'liking' (pleasure) explains why we compulsively seek digital stimulation even when it's not truly satisfying.

*   **Evidence Chip:** Mesolimbic dopamine is crucial for "wanting" (motivational pursuit) but not "liking" (pleasurable impact). This dissociation means digital cues can trigger intense craving and seeking, even if the actual engagement is not deeply pleasurable or fulfilling. [R1-C02, R1-C03, R1-C04, R1-C05, R2-C08]
*   **Narrative Angle:** Delves into the neurobiology of desire versus satisfaction, showing how digital design keeps us "wanting" more without necessarily delivering deeper "liking."

### Claim 3: Frequent task-switching and constant digital stimulation deplete baseline dopamine and impair sustained focus, but breaks and strategic environment design can restore capacity for deep work.

*   **Evidence Chip:** Multitasking and interruptions incur significant cognitive costs ("attention residue"), reducing productivity. Continuous digital stimulation can lead to dopamine "overdrive" and subsequent dullness, making it harder to feel motivated by normal activities. Conversely, breaks and single-context environments can restore dopamine sensitivity and focus. [R2-C07, R2-C11, R5-C01, R5-C03]
*   **Narrative Angle:** Highlights the cost of fragmented attention on our neurochemistry and offers a science-backed rationale for structured focus and downtime.

## Diagram Notes

*   **"Ping/Scroll Loop" (Diagram 1):** Illustrate the cycle of external cue/boredom -> anticipation & craving (dopamine spike) -> checking -> variable reward (hit/miss) -> increased craving. Include "Intervention" breakpoints like turning off cues or mindful pauses.

## Protocol Steps: Focus Sprint (7-Day Experiment Outline)

*   **Concept:** Structured work interval (e.g., 25-60 min) of uninterrupted, single-task focus, followed by a short break. Builds "focus muscle."
*   **Key Steps:**
    1.  **Time-Boxing:** Choose a sprint length (25/45/60 min).
    2.  **Eliminate Distractions:** Close email, silence phone (put in another room).
    3.  **Commitment:** "I will only work on this one task for X minutes. If impulse arises, jot it down and return to task."
    4.  **Reward:** When timer ends, stop and take a guilt-free break (stretch, walk, stare out window â€“ no screens).
    5.  **Repeat:** 3-4 cycles for a solid block of deep work.
*   **Rationale/Evidence Chips (for Protocol):**
    *   Leverages immediate deadline/goal to counter delay discounting.
    *   Pre-planned reward (break) makes delaying gratification easier.
    *   Avoids dopamine depletion from multitasking; allows flow state.
    *   Creates positive prediction errors (break time already!).
    *   Strengthens brain's ability to produce dopamine from accomplishment, not distractions.
    *   *Reference:* Original "Attention & Drive in a Distracting Economy" PDF, pages 6-7 ("Playbook 1: The Focus Sprint").
*   **Limits & Safety:** (Placeholder to remind me to add these details when drafting the full prose, as per Gate B2).
    *   Acknowledge initial "withdrawal" or discomfort.
    *   Stress the importance of actual breaks, not just task switching.
    *   Emphasize that this is an experiment, not a rigid prescription for all work.
