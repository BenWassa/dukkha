# Evidence-Based Protocols Status

The index page advertises **"7 Evidence-Based Protocols"**, but only two protocol guides are present in the repository:

## Existing Protocols
1. **Focus Sprint (7-Day Experiment)** – structured intervals to rebuild sustained attention.
2. **Recovery Reset (48-Hour Experiment)** – weekend retreat to restore dopamine baseline and reduce stress.

## What's Missing
Five additional protocols would be needed to match the promise of seven. Potential areas include:
- **Sleep Optimization:** circadian rhythm and sleep hygiene practices.
- **Stress Management:** breathwork, social support, and cognitive reframing techniques.
- **Digital Detox:** structured periods without high-frequency stimulation.
- **Nutrition & Supplementation:** diet guidelines that support dopamine production.
- **Mindfulness & Reflection:** journaling, meditation, and habit tracking to cultivate awareness.

If expanding to seven protocols feels excessive for the project's scope, consider revising the claim on the index page until more guides are added.
